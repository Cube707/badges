# badges

This package aims to make it easy to create static, standardized badges for your
projects using the [shields.io](https://shields.io) API. It also provides a wide variety
of pre-generated, ready to use badges for your convenience.

This project is heavily inspired by the existing
[_badges_ project by Allen42](https://github.com/aleen42/badges). It provides the same
functionality only implemented in python and provides most of the same badges. If this
project ever matures enough, it might be possible to merge the projects into one,
providing APIs/tool for multiple languages.

## Installation

For now, it is not published, so you can only install from directly from the repo.
